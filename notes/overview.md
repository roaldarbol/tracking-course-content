# Overview

Here we can create link to other meeting notes. See e.g. [this test note](test-note.md).

- [idtracker.ai has added support for Mac](https://gitlab.com/polavieja_lab/idtrackerai/-/issues/76#note_1420532526)
- Tested installation of both DeepLabCut, SLEAP and idtracker.ai on Windows - SLEAP is much much easier to install than DLC and idtracker.ai is also a breeze. I think we should focus on those two. They can also both be installed almost as easily on MacOS).
- [Sleap has some good teaching resources](https://github.com/talmolab/sleap-tutorial-uo).
